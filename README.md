# Data Structures Portfolio

## [Linear & Binary Searches](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Searches.ipynb)
This notebook features two searching methods: linear and binary.

## [Linked Lists](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Linked%20List.ipynb)
This code emulates how computers create lists at a low level using Python.

## [Binary Tree](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Binary%20Tree.ipynb)
This code creates binary trees and their nodes using classes in Python.

## [Machine Learning Titanic](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)
Kaggle runs a machine learning competition using data from the Titanic sinking: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
## [Machine Learning Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Spaceship%20Titanic.ipynb)
Kaggle runs a machine learning competition based on the Titanic sinking themed around space travel with a larger dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic
## [Heaps](https://github.com/bedrockskeleton/data-structures/blob/main/Heap.ipynb)
Similar to binary trees, max heaps store data in a tree structure with the largest items higher up in the tree. This implementation was coded in Python.
